* No mention of cultural references in the intro?
* I don't get the point of figure 1.c
* Result plots (b, d) in Figure 3 are hard to see. Either separate or place make the figure bigger (more portait).

# Results
* Clarification for the statistical test for the systematic biases?
* They use the concept "predictable patterns" without defining it properly in the introduction (and repeating the definition in results).

# Supplementary
* Recommendation to use bar plot instead of pie plots as they are easier to read.

* Shannon entropy equations cannot be read
